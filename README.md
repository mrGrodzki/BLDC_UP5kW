# BLDC_UP5kW

The main task of the project: building a low-cost BLDC driver up to 5kW. The driver components should also be available during the market crisis.

To reduce the cost of the driver, each phase has a separate power module.

Module made on aluminum PCB, for better heat dissipation to the heat sink from the transistors in the smd housing.
